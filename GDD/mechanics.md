# Gameplay Mechanics

## Core Mechanics

- **Movement**

  - _Player Movement_: The character can be moved using the arrow keys or the "WASD" keys. This allows for flexible control schemes catering to player preferences.

  - _Special Movement_:
    - _Dash_: The "F" key triggers a dash move, propelling the character swiftly towards the direction of the mouse pointer. This can be used for quick escapes or to close gaps rapidly.
    - _Sprint_: Holding down the Shift key enables the character to sprint. Sprinting increases the character's movement speed significantly and is infinite in duration. Pressing the Shift key again will cancel the sprint.

- **Combat**

  - _Close Combat_: Melee attacks are vital for surviving close encounters. These attacks do minimal damage but are effective in pushing enemies away, creating space for strategic positioning or retreat.
  - _Distance Combat_:
    - _Energy Pistol_: The primary ranged weapon is an energy-based automatic pistol. This pistol has different types of shots that can be selected and changed through the skill tree. Players can customize their weapon to suit their playstyle and can revert changes if desired. Types of shots may include standard energy blasts, piercing shots, explosive rounds, and more, each with unique effects and advantages.
    - _Grenades_:
      - _Standard Grenade_: Deals high damage within its explosion radius. Players need to be cautious, as being within the blast range will cause them to take damage as well.
      - _Flash Bang Grenade_: Emits a blinding flash and a loud bang that slows down enemies within its range. Players must also be cautious to avoid its effects, as it can slow them down if they are within its range.

- **Health and Shields**

  - _Health_: Health can be found throughout the map in the form of health packs or other restorative items. Health determines the player's survivability, and running out of health will result in the player's death.

  - _Shield_: Shields provide an additional layer of protection and can also be found around the map. Shields absorb damage before health is affected, offering a strategic buffer in combat. Both health and shields can be replenished by finding respective items scattered throughout the environment.

- **Environment Interactions**

  - _Cover_: Players can take cover behind objects to avoid enemy fire. The cover system provides strategic advantages and encourages tactical gameplay.

  - _Interactive Objects_: The game world includes objects that players can interact with, such as doors, switches, and items that can be picked up or manipulated.

  - _Destructible Objects_: Certain objects in the environment can be destroyed, affecting the battlefield dynamically. This can be used to create new pathways or eliminate enemy cover.

- **Enemy Behavior**

  - **Enemy Types**

    - _Basic Enemies_: Standard foes with simple attack patterns.
    - _Ranged Enemies_: Attack from a distance, requiring the player to use cover and strategy.
    - _Melee Enemies_: Engage in close combat, pushing the player to maintain distance.

  - _Mini Bosses_: Tougher enemies with more complex attack patterns and higher health, serving as mid-level challenges.

  - _Bosses_: Major adversaries with unique abilities, multi-phase battles, and significant narrative importance. [More info](GDD/characters.md)

- **Progression and Upgrades**

  - _Experience Points (XP)_: Players earn XP by defeating enemies and completing objectives. XP is used to level up and unlock new abilities.

  - _Skill Tree_: The skill tree allows players to customize their character's abilities and weapon types. Through the skill tree, players can unlock different types of shots for the energy pistol and other abilities. This allows for a tailored combat experience and strategic flexibility.
